Parameters
==========

Runtime parameters are passed to :class:`radhydropy.params.Par` as a dictionary.
Missing keys are filled from :data:`radhydropy.params.refparams`.

Hydrogen Thermo-Chemistry Keys
------------------------------

Hydrogen thermo-chemistry is disabled by default. Set
``hydrogen_chemistry=True`` to evolve the neutral hydrogen fraction
``xHI = nHI / nH`` and apply the associated line, ionization, bremsstrahlung,
and case-B recombination cooling source terms. Source terms are subcycled
inside each hydrodynamic step: the thermal equation is advanced explicitly,
then the updated temperature is used for a backward-Euler neutral-fraction
solve.
